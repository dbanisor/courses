      <h3 class="experience-title">SharePoint Digital Coach</h3>
        <h4>SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Global Solution Centre and Inetum Romania<br>March 2019 â€“ Present</h4>
        <p>I created a Python app that would help gather training feedbacks from multiple Excel files, centralize them in an existing or new file and then run some calculations in order to present some performance indices. For this app I used Tkinter, pandas, shutil, os, openpyxl, and datetime.
</p>
        <p>I managed to solve over 900 support cases on SharePoint On Premise.
             At my trainings, there were over 350 users trained on SharePoint 2016 and Iâ€™ve created and started trainings on a new tool, SharePoint Online with currently over 150 users trained.
            Iâ€™ve adapted and improved the support and the trainings provided to users on the before mentioned tools in order to better respond to the usersâ€™ needs.
            Also, besides providing users with specific answers I have tried to foresee future cases and come up with helpful procedures.
            In addition, Iâ€™ve replicated the same trainings available for French users in Romania as well, for Romanian speakers.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities:<br>
            â€¢ Provide support to all users in the company for SharePoint 2016<br>
            â€¢ Conduct online trainings for SharePoint 2016 and SharePoint Online</p>

      <h3 class="experience-title">Freelance English and French Corporate Trainer</h3><h4>June 2017 â€“ March 2019</h4>
        <p>I managed to help people learn English and French through effective learning techniques (e.g. interactive dialogues, discussions based on business related videos in English/French, team exercises, vocabulary games etc.) and to also teach them business skills (e.g. time management matrix) through these two languages. I also designed my own coursework which covered the participantsâ€™ need for custom training sessions, adapted to each class and level (elementary, pre-intermediate and intermediate).
            Clients: REWE Romania (Penny Market), EXE Software.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities:<br>

      <h3 class="experience-title">Business Advisor</h3> <h4>Oracle Romania<br>August 2016 â€“ May 2017</h4>
        <p>I took the initiative and created an online database in Apex to be able to track an important type of license contracts for the Nordic countries and Switzerland.
            This database improved the visibility over the fundamental follow-up in order to assure the continuity of a contract or the need for renegotiations for the sales teams.
            I implemented online presentations as training materials, with step-by-step instructions, that were very well received and replaced PowerPoint trainings.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities:<br>
            â€¢ Provide programs to improve operational efficiency, consistency, and compliance in support of the organizationâ€™s financial and tactical business objectives<br>

      <h3 class="experience-title">Contracts Administrator</h3> <h4>Oracle Romania<br>June 2015 â€“ August 2016</h4>
        <p>I created an Excel file with macros that would calculate the exact price of a product purchased from a pre-existing Price Hold designed in a different currency than the one currently quoted.
            This file improved the Contracts Administratorsâ€™ and Sales processing time spent per contract and was shared at department level.
            I joined the Training team and delivered Microsoft Excel beginner and intermediate level trainings to colleagues within the department.
            I worked on designing a completely non-standard agreement for one of the most valuable customers in the License Department and collaborated with Deal Management, Sales team and Legal team for three months
            in order to have the agreement signed by the end of the quarter.</p>
        <p>Responsibilities:<br>
            â€¢ Create, validate and process contract documentation using Oracle's standard document templates, a set of contract options and in accordance

            implemented the according procedures.</p>
